# Better-Password-Generator

Password Generator v2 - Written in C.
---

Something to note, my old one wasn't bad, per se.

However, 'cause I was bored, I decided to make it better.

:)

So, if you want a decent password generator, you've come to the right place.

Welcome All! To Password-Gen v2 <3

Better code, clears memory of password and file name - I decided to create another version - for people who like CLI <3

And, this version is practically the same, regarding cryptography, jus' a lil different ;)

I was more mindful of stuff this time - and I actually spent time writing it, unlike my last one ðŸ˜…

I could make this better - with the use of an external library, but eh - we'll leave that to the C++ goofy goobers(ðŸ¤“).
